# Course Competencies and/or Standards 
Computer Programming standards are called competencies. You can find the competencies for
this course in the College Board's [[Course and Exam Description Document]{.underline}](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf)

# Syllabus Quiz
Please review this syllabus with a parent or guardian, and complete
"Syllabus Quiz" in Canvas by Tuesday, September 6, 2022.


In the Syllabus Quiz, there will be a question that says "Did you read
the entire syllabus?" Please use that box to tell me about your favorite animal.

# Class Expectations for Students and Teacher 

-   Students are expected to follow the [Acceptable Use
    Policy](http://www.apsva.us/domain/2167) as well as other school
    policies

-   Arrive on time

-   Be mindful of your neighbors' workspaces

-   During lecture time, please close your laptop and take off your
    headphones

-   During work time (not quiz/test time), you are encouraged to work
    with others, but DO NOT do their work for them

-   No food or drink in the lab area

-   Keep the lab clean -- no trash!

-   When it is time to leave you should throw away any trash at your
    station, straighten the keyboard and mouse, and push in your chair

# Communication Expectations

-   Students are encouraged to ask for help in class, but all official requests to Mr. Jones (eg for assignment clarifications, extensions, recommendations) must be made in writing

-   Mr. Jones is happy to communicate with students and their families via email, Canvas messages, and ParentSquare

-   Mr. Jones makes every effort to respond to all communication within one school day

-   Student messages to Mr. Jones must be formal and professional. Mr. Jones will request that students re-write emails that do not meet this standard. [See this link](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/format-for-formal-email) for help writing formal emails.

# Industry Credentialing Certification/Licensure

Credentials are industry certifications to validate student skill
attainment to a potential employer or college admissions officer. These
tests, recognized by industry, are at no cost to the student. Students
in this course will be eligible to take:

**Workplace Readiness Skills Exam \-- [[Objectives found
here]{.underline}](https://www.ctecs.org/wrs-modules)**

**AP Computer Science Principles Exam** 

# Career & Technical Student Organization (CTSO)

A CTSO is a required co-curricular student professional organization
that aligns with the course. While some activities may be done during
class time, others are extracurricular activities. The CTSO for this
course is called Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA). For
additional information, see <https://www.vafbla-pbl.org/> or contact Mr. Welsch.

# Academic Integrity

In this course, collaboration among students is encouraged. However,
copying another's work or allowing your work to be copied is not
acceptable and is a violation of Wakefield's academic integrity policy.
Some assignments will require students to sign an honor pledge. By
signing the pledge, students acknowledge their understanding of the
honor policy and that they have not violated that policy in any way. The
pledge states either: 

*\"On my honor, I pledge that I have neither given nor received
information on this assignment.\"*

or

*\"On my honor, I pledge that I have only given \[received\] information
on this assignment to \[from\] the following individual(s) ....\"*

Failure to abide by the honor code will result in consequences as laid
out in the student handbook, but at minimum students will earn a zero on
the relevant assignment.

# Grading Overview

## Assessments

The grade in this class is based entirely on summative assessments. Each standard will be assessed twice - once with a written exam and once with a project (usually a coding assignment).

This class utilizes both formative and summative assessments. The teacher will clearly explain which assignments are formative and which are summative. 
- Formative assessments are assessments **for** learning - these include programming exercises, lab assignments, teacher-guided projects, worksheets, scaffolded programming problems, writing prompts, warmups, exit tickets, and surveys. Feedback will be given for these assignments but they will not impact the final grade. Students should view these assignments as practice.

- Summative assessment are assessments **of** learning - these occur at the end of a teaching unit and after sufficient practice and feedback. These include Tests, quizzes, culminating projects, demonstrations, and research papers.

## Grade Composition 

Students are assessed in the categories in the table below.

+--------------+-------------+----------------------------------------+
| **Category** | **Weighted  | **Description**                        |
|              | Percentage**|                                        |
+==============+=============+========================================+
| Formative    | > 0%        | Performance-based                      |
| Assessments  |             | activities designed to allow the       |
|              |             | students to practice new skills.       |
+--------------+-------------+----------------------------------------+
| Summative    | > 100%      | The student will demonstrate their     |
| Assessments  |             | competency attainment of technical     |
|              |             | skills.                                |
|              |             | Includes performance-based             |
|              |             | and theoretical application.           |
+--------------+-------------+----------------------------------------+
Summative Assessments are evaluated using a points-based system, where larger-effort assignments are worth more points than smaller-effort assignments.

## Homework - [[Policy Implementation Procedure I-11.2 PIP-1 Homework]{.underline}](https://go.boarddocs.com/vsba/arlington/Board.nsf/files/CFTQMG69C32F/$file/I-11.2%20PIP-1%20Homework.pdf) 

Homework allows students to practice, prepare, study, and extend
learning. Homework is not assigned as a behavioral consequence.

-   **Grades 9-12:** maximum of a total of 60 minutes per week per
    course; an additional 30 minutes of independent, choice reading each
    night is recommended. Students who are enrolled in Advanced
    Placement, International Baccalaureate, and/or dual enrolled courses
    may be assigned additional work commensurate with the expectations
    of the course.

# Special Expectations for AP Classes

AP classes provide amazing opportunities to study diverse offerings with the rigor of college level courses.  We want you to do well and succeed in these courses and encourage you to seek out all the support available to make your experience positive.  As an advanced course, we do want to ensure that you are prepared for the content.  As such, students are expected to perform at or above a “C” average. Students will earn extra quality points when they complete the course and Create Task and sit for the external AP examination. Students who complete both on time will be exempt from final examinations for this course. Students who fail to submit the required Create Task will not be eligible to sit for the external examination. Failure to sit for the external examination will result in the loss of the quality point on the school transcript and they will be required to take a final exam on the date specified in the WHS calendar.  If this happens, the final course grade will be an average of the four quarter grades and the final exam grade.

Arlington Public Schools (APS) pays for the examination fees for all AP and IB courses.  Any student who registers for an AP or IB course, but does not take the corresponding exam or complete the required IB internal assessment (IA), will be required to reimburse APS for their examination fee(s).  The cost of each exam is established by the College Board and International Baccalaureate Organization. 

## Retake Policy

All summative assessments have a retake/ revision option after remediation. The higher score (the original or the retake) will be used to calculate the student grade.

In order to qualify for a retake, students must first turn in all formative work for the associated unit.

All tests retakes will be accomplished via a single cumulative exam that will be given at the end of each quarter. Students will choose whether to take some, all, or none of the quarter exam.

Specific instructions, timelines, and formats for project retakes will be provided on a case-by-case basis as determined by the instructor.

## Final Exam Information

This course does have a final exam. Students whose overall grade for
the year is already an A may request to be exempted from the exam.

## Absences 

Students are expected to complete all assignments. Students who are
absent are expected to check Canvas to find out what they missed and
to be ready to move forward upon their return. Missed work due to an
absence is expected to be completed as outlined by [[Arlington Public
Schools Attendance
Policy]{.underline}](https://www.apsva.us/attendance/absences/). Help
is available to students by contacting the teacher via email to make
an appointment for academic support.

## Late Policy 

All work will have a due date and it is important to complete the work
on-time as the technical skills in this course build upon each other.
While late work is not penalized in the grade calculation, there is a
finite amount of time in which missing assignments will be accepted.
Assignments will not be accepted later than one week from the original
due date. Missing work will be recorded in the Gradebook as "Missing"
and calculated as a zero until submitted and graded.

It is understood that extenuating circumstances may arise in which
work cannot be submitted on-time. In such cases, the student is
expected to communicate with the teacher, in advance, so a
conversation regarding a solution can be discussed.

## Gradebook

All graded summative assessments will be appear in Synergy. Some formative work will be completed in other platforms and will not be viewable on Canvas or Synergy.

# Sexually Explicit Material

The course list of resources provided on this syllabus are those which are planned to be used this school year in this course. As required by Virginia Code, parents/guardians must be notified when instructional resources which contain sexually explicit content are assigned for a classroom assignment at least thirty (30) days prior to the assignment being given to the student. As instructional needs of students may vary, additional resources may be determined to be used for instruction in this course. When this occurs, parents/guardians will also be notified of the use of the resource. Upon receipt of the notification, parents/guardians may ask to review the resource and, if desired, request an alternative resource to be used with their student.
