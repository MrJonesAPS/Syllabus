# Prerequisite
Students are expected to have completed Computer Programming with a final grade of C or better.
Any student who does not satisfy this prerequisite must discuss with Mr. Jones. Students may be allowed to remain in the class with instructor's approval, which will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

# Course Description & Course Goals
Building on their foundation of programming skills, Advanced Programming students use object-oriented programming to develop database applications, interactive multimedia applications including game applications, mobile applications, and web applications. Students continue to develop their employability skills as they research pathways for continuing education and careers in the information technology industry and engage in various career-building activities. Contextual instruction and student participation in co-curricular career and technical student organization (CTSO) activities will develop leadership, interpersonal, and career skills. High-quality work-based learning (HQWBL) will provide experiential learning opportunities related to students' career goals and/or interests, integrated with instruction, and performed in partnership with local businesses and organizations.

# Class Expectations for Students and Teacher 

-   Students are expected to follow the [Acceptable Use
    Policy](http://www.apsva.us/domain/2167) as well as other school
    policies

-   Arrive on time

-   Be mindful of your neighbors' workspaces

-   During lecture time, please close your laptop and take off your
    headphones

-   During work time (not quiz/test time), you are encouraged to work
    with others, but DO NOT do their work for them

-   No food or drink in the lab area

-   Keep the lab clean -- no trash!

-   When it is time to leave you should throw away any trash at your
    station, straighten the keyboard and mouse, and push in your chair

# Communication Expectations

-   Students are encouraged to ask for help in class, but all official requests to Mr. Jones (eg for assignment clarifications, extensions, recommendations) must be made in writing

-   Mr. Jones is happy to communicate with students and their families via email, Canvas messages, and ParentSquare

-   Mr. Jones makes every effort to respond to all communication within one school day

-   Student messages to Mr. Jones must be formal and professional. Mr. Jones will request that students re-write emails that do not meet this standard. [See this link](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/format-for-formal-email) for help writing formal emails.

# Industry Credentialing Certification/Licensures

Credentials are industry certifications to validate student skill
attainment to a potential employer or college admissions officer. These
tests, recognized by industry, are at no cost to the student. Students
in this course will be eligible to take:

**Workplace Readiness Skills Exam \-- [[Objectives found
here]{.underline}](https://www.ctecs.org/wrs-modules)**

**PCEP - Certified Entry Level Python Programmer -** [**[Objectives
found
here]{.underline}**](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep-exam-syllabus)

# Career & Technical Student Organization (CTSO)

A CTSO is a required co-curricular student professional organization
that aligns with the course. While some activities may be done during
class time, others are extracurricular activities. The CTSO for this
course is called Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA). For
additional information, see <https://www.vafbla-pbl.org/> or contact Ms.
Naughton

# Academic Integrity

In this course, collaboration among students is encouraged. However,
copying another's work or allowing your work to be copied is not
acceptable and is a violation of Wakefield's academic integrity policy.
Some assignments will require students to sign an honor pledge. By
signing the pledge, students acknowledge their understanding of the
honor policy and that they have not violated that policy in any way. The
pledge states either: 

*\"On my honor, I pledge that I have neither given nor received
information on this assignment.\"*

or

*\"On my honor, I pledge that I have only given \[received\] information
on this assignment to \[from\] the following individual(s) ....\"*

Failure to abide by the honor code will result in consequences as laid
out in the student handbook, but at minimum students will earn a zero on
the relevant assignment.

# Grading Overview

## Grade Composition 

The final grade for the course is determined using a "quality points"
system. Each quarter will represent 20% of the final grade, and the
final exam will also be worth 20%. Each quarter, students are assessed
on the categories in the table below.

+--------------+-------------+----------------------------------------+
| **Category** | **Weighted  | **Description**                        |
|              | Percentage**|                                        |
+==============+=============+========================================+
| Projects     | > 50%       | Performance-based                      |
| and Labs     |             | activities designed to allow the       |
|              |             | students to practice new skills. These |
|              |             | are formative assessments.             |
+--------------+-------------+----------------------------------------+
|              | > 50%       | The student will demonstrate their     |
| Assessments  |             | competency attainment of technical     |
|              |             | skills. Summative assessments          |
|              |             | generally combine performance-based    |
|              |             | and theoretical application.           |
+--------------+-------------+----------------------------------------+
Each of these categories is evaluated using a points-based system, where larger-effort assignments are worth more points than smaller-effort assignments.

## Homework - [Policy Implementation Procedure I-11.2 PIP-1 Homework](https://go.boarddocs.com/vsba/arlington/Board.nsf/files/CFTQMG69C32F/$file/I-11.2%20PIP-1%20Homework.pdf) 

Homework allows students to practice, prepare, study, and extend
learning. Homework is not assigned as a behavioral consequence.

-   **Grades 9-12:** maximum of a total of 60 minutes per week per
    course; an additional 30 minutes of independent, choice reading each
    night is recommended. Students who are enrolled in Advanced
    Placement, International Baccalaureate, and/or dual enrolled courses
    may be assigned additional work commensurate with the expectations
    of the course.


## Final Exam Information

This course does have a final exam. Students whose overall grade for
the year is already an A may request to be exempted from the exam.

## Absences 

Students are expected to complete all assignments. Students who are
absent are expected to check Canvas to find out what they missed and
to be ready to move forward upon their return. Missed work due to an
absence is expected to be completed as outlined by [[Arlington Public
Schools Attendance
Policy]{.underline}](https://www.apsva.us/attendance/absences/). Help
is available to students by contacting the teacher via email to make
an appointment for academic support.

## Late Policy 

All work will have a due date and it is important to complete the work
on-time as the technical skills in this course build upon each other.
While late work is not penalized in the grade calculation, there is a
finite amount of time in which missing assignments will be accepted.
Assignments will not be accepted later than one week from the original
due date. Missing work will be recorded in the Gradebook as "Missing"
and calculated as a zero until submitted and graded.

It is understood that extenuating circumstances may arise in which
work cannot be submitted on-time. In such cases, the student is
expected to communicate with the teacher, in advance, so a
conversation regarding a solution can be discussed.

## Gradebook

All graded items will be in Canvas, and only Interim/Quarter grades
will be entered in StudentVUE/Synergy

**Note:** [Student grades reflect student achievement]{.underline} and
not student behavior. Quarterly grades will round up when the
percentage is .5 or higher. Work Habits, such as Homework, will be
reflected in the report card comments. + = Surpasses expectations, \#
= Meets Expectations, \^= Approaching Expectations and N = Needs
Improvement.

## Calculating Final Course Grades

Final grades will be calculated using quality points. Each quarter and
final exam will count for 20% of the final grade.
