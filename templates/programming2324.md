{% block year %}2023-2024{% endblock %}

{% block prerequisite %}
Students are expected to have completed Algebra 1 with a final grade of C or better.
{% endblock %}

{% block coursedescription %}
Students in the Programming course explore programming concepts, use
algorithmic procedures, implement programming procedures with one or
more standard languages, and master programming fundamentals. Coding is
used throughout the course. Graphical user interfaces may be used as
students design and develop interactive multimedia applications,
including game programs. In addition, students employ hypertext markup
language (HTML) or JavaScript to create web pages. Students develop
their employability skills through a variety of activities. Contextual
instruction and student participation in co-curricular career and
technical student organization (CTSO) activities will develop
leadership, interpersonal, and career skills. High-quality work-based
learning (HQWBL) will provide experiential learning opportunities
related to students\' career goals and/or interests, integrated with
instruction, and performed in partnership with local businesses and
organizations.
