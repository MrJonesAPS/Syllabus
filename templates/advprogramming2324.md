{% block coursedescription %}
Building on their foundation of programming skills, Advanced Programming students use object-oriented programming to develop database applications, interactive multimedia applications including game applications, mobile applications, and web applications. Students continue to develop their employability skills as they research pathways for continuing education and careers in the information technology industry and engage in various career-building activities. Contextual instruction and student participation in co-curricular career and technical student organization (CTSO) activities will develop leadership, interpersonal, and career skills. High-quality work-based learning (HQWBL) will provide experiential learning opportunities related to students' career goals and/or interests, integrated with instruction, and performed in partnership with local businesses and organizations.
