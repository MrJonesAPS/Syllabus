# Special Expectations for AP Classes

AP classes provide amazing opportunities to study diverse offerings with the rigor of college level courses.  We want you to do well and succeed in these courses and encourage you to seek out all the support available to make your experience positive.  As an advanced course, we do want to ensure that you are prepared for the content.  As such, students are expected to perform at or above a “C” average. Students will earn extra quality points when they complete the course and Create Task and sit for the external AP examination. Students who complete both on time will be exempt from final examinations for this course. Students who fail to submit the required Create Task will not be eligible to sit for the external examination. Failure to sit for the external examination will result in the loss of the quality point on the school transcript and they will be required to take a final exam on the date specified in the WHS calendar.  If this happens, the final course grade will be an average of the four quarter grades and the final exam grade.

Arlington Public Schools (APS) pays for the examination fees for all AP and IB courses.  Any student who registers for an AP or IB course, but does not take the corresponding exam or complete the required IB internal assessment (IA), will be required to reimburse APS for their examination fee(s).  The cost of each exam is established by the College Board and International Baccalaureate Organization.
